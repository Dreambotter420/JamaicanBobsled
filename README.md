Just say the words and awaken the manchurian candidate


# What this is
This is a code package for a Dreambot script that you can export to .jar yourself using an IDE like Eclipse IDE like I use. If you need help with that part look it up on dreambot forums. When you run the script it will turn your character into a manchurian candidate that listens explicitly to voice commands in public chat and acts upon them. When you have many characters running this script at once in W301 it is very amusing and that is the purpose of the script. 


# Commands / The Goods
To utterly dictate your manchurian candidate's will towards the ultimate goals of your every whim, here are some convenient syntax usages and examples.

# Does Tutorial Island for Your Lazy Ass
In case you would ever want to purchase e-mail/password combinations that have been pre-registered onto the runescape.com website illicitly (I assume no liability for any actions taken before or after the monetization of alleged infringed intellectual property rights of any parties mentioned in this README) and then use those to mass-launch new manchurian candidates using Dreambot's VIP CLI feature, this script comes prepared with Tutorial Island logic (because you know you're going to get banned doing this lol)
In order to populate the Runescape Username field at the beginning of Tutorial Island, this script requires a file "usernames.txt" to be placed in the directory [%USERNAME%\DreamBot\Script\usernames.txt]. For example C:\Users\Administrator\DreamBot\Scripts\usernames.txt. One username per line. The script will read the first line, type it out, then delete the first line, then if the name is taken it reads the first line again. The character clothing and coloring will be randomly chosen from a set of Power Ranger-like appearances (for example: https://i.imgur.com/PAKzVL9.png ) in either green/cyan/deep blue/deep red/yellow/black/purple.
